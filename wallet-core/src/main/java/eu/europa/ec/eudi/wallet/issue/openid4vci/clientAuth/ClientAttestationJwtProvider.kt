/**
 * Provider that handles communication with wallet provider backend to obtain attestation JWT.
 *
 * This functional interface defines the contract for obtaining attestation JWTs during the
 * OpenID4VCI client attestation flow. Implementors communicate with their wallet provider
 * backend service to exchange public key information for a signed attestation JWT.
 *
 * ## Key Lifecycle
 * The attestation key is persisted and bound to the CredentialIssuerId. The same key will be
 * reused for subsequent issuance requests from the same issuer, so the provider should handle
 * both initial key attestation and potential key reuse scenarios.
 *
 * ## Implementation Responsibilities
 * 1. Receive the [KeyInfo] containing the public key and key metadata
 * 2. Extract and format the public key (typically as JWK)
 * 3. Send the public key to your wallet provider backend endpoint
 * 4. Receive and validate the attestation JWT from the wallet provider
 * 5. Return the JWT wrapped in a [Result]
 *
 * ## Example Implementation
 * ```kotlin
 * val provider = ClientAttestationJwtProvider { keyInfo, challenge ->
 *     try {
 *         // Extract public key in JWK format
 *         val publicKeyJwk = keyInfo.publicKey.toJwk().toString()
 *
 *         // Call your backend service
 *         val response = httpClient.post("https://wallet-provider.example.com/attestation") {
 *             setBody(AttestationRequest(
 *                 publicKey = publicKeyJwk,
 *                 challenge = challenge
 *             ))
 *         }
 *
 *         Result.success(response.body<AttestationResponse>().jwt)
 *     } catch (e: Exception) {
 *         Result.failure(e)
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see [ClientAttestationConfig] for configuring attestation-based authentication
 * @see [KeyInfo] for key information structure

     * This method is called by the library during the attestation flow. Implementors should:
     * 1. Extract the public key from [keyInfo] (e.g., `keyInfo.publicKey.toJwk().toString()`)
     * 2. Send it to their wallet provider backend along with the [challenge] if present
     * 3. Receive the attestation JWT from the wallet provider
     * 4. Return it wrapped in a [Result]
     *
     * The attestation JWT received from the wallet provider should be a signed JWT that proves
     * the authenticity of the client and binds it to the public key.
     *
     * @param keyInfo The key information including the public key to send to wallet provider.
     *                Access the public key via `keyInfo.publicKey` and convert to JWK format.
     * @param challenge The challenge used during key creation. This may be null if no challenge
     *                  was provided in the [ClientAttestationConfig]. If present, it should be
     *                  included in the attestation request to the wallet provider.
     * @return [Result] containing the attestation JWT string received from the wallet provider
     *         on success, or an exception on failure.
     *
     * @see [ClientAttestationConfig.challenge] for challenge configuration
